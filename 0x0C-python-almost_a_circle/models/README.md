# Models
This directory encompasses three classes, each serving a distinct purpose:
- Base: Positioned as the cornerstone of all models, this class establishes fundamental attributes such as object identifiers and maintains an exhaustive record of every model instance created within the system.
- Rectangle: This class inherits from Base and extends its functionality, focusing specifically on geometric representations of rectangles, encompassing properties and methods pertinent to their manipulation and analysis.
- Square: Building upon the Rectangle class, Square further refines the geometric abstraction to specifically represent square shapes, inheriting the properties and behaviors defined within Rectangle while adding specific functionalities tailored to squares.
